    <ol>
        <li>Grease inside of 5-quart crock pot with butter or spray it with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>
            Starting with sausage, layer the cooked and drained meat, onions, peppers, chiles, and 
            cheese into the slow cooker, repeating the layering process until all of the ingredients are used.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large mixer bowl, beat the eggs with a wire whisk or eggbeater until combined, 
            then pour over mixture in the crockpot.

        <li>
            Cover the slow cooker and cook on low 7 to 8 hours or until the temperature reaches at least 165 F.
